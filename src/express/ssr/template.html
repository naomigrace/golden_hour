    <p style="line-height: 20px;">
      A temporary solution is to comment the line in /src/server/index.js that
      contains 'app.use(historyApiFallback())'. You should then be able to hit
      the route and see the intended result. It is not recommended, but if done,
      please don't forget to uncomment the line before working on the front-end
      or deploying the app...otherwise there'll most likely be issues with the
      react-router for client-side-routing.

    <p style="line-height: 20px;">
      If you're on your local machine and you ran the script 'npm run demo', the
      NODE_ENV needs to be set to 'production'. To set your environment
      variable, create a .env file in the project's root folder and write
      'NODE_ENV=production' in it. Once saved, you will need to stop the server
      and restart it via npm script.
